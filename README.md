## App_Overview

### Sign-Up Page
- Users can create an account by providing a valid name, username, email, and password. The app enforces strong validation rules to ensure data integrity.

### Sign-In Page
- Existing users can sign in using their username and password. The app checks credentials against the Firebase Realtime Database and displays appropriate messages for incorrect or non-existent users.

### Dashboard
- After successful sign-in, users are redirected to a dashboard where their details such as name, username, and email are displayed, fetched directly from Firebase.

---

## Features
- **Secure Authentication**: Implements Firebase Realtime Database for storing and retrieving user data with secure validation rules.
- **Front-end and Back-end Validation**: Ensures user inputs are validated both in the app and on the server side.
- **Intuitive UI**: Simple and user-friendly interface designed with Material Design principles.
- **Real-time Data**: User information is fetched in real-time from Firebase and displayed on the dashboard.
